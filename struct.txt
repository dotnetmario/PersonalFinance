Personal finance is a simple way to keep traking of your spending and earnings

Classes :

        Fields :
            User => User owner

    User :
        desc => the user
        Fields :
            Firstname, Lastname, Email, Phone, Birthday, Photo, Bio



Keeping tabs :
    User registration is done, seems like it's all good but you never know
    Income, IncomePrice, IncomeTransaction crud is done (also need alot of testing, phpunit)
    Expence, ExpencePrice, ExpenceTransaction crud is done (also need alot of testing, phpunit)


Next :
    Need a event system to automaticly update the balance of a user in case of an 
    income or expence transaction

    Need to find an efficient way to calculate the steady incomes/expences without user interference
    the solution has to be light on resources with minimal read/writes to the database
